       This study will design and create a Real-time GPS Tracking and Monitoring System for Batangas Transport Cooperative using IoT device and Cloud Computing that will track and monitor the public utility vehicle of Batangas Transport Cooperative (BATRASCO). This project will create an IoT device that is capable of tracking and monitoring the precise position of current PUVs as well as the speed of BATRASCO's public utility vehicles. The data will be handled by the project through the development of a web-based application that will help the admin of the cooperative to monitor their public utility vehicles. The web application would store and process the data provided by the IoT device, allowing the user more control over how these devices are used. It also displays the vehicle's current location and timestamps.
